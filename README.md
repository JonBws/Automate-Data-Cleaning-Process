# Automated Data Cleaning Process
In this project, I am developing a Streamlit-based website to automate the data cleaning process. Users can upload an Excel file containing data to be cleaned and download the cleaned Excel file afterward. Specifically, the data cleaning process involves creating a new column based on an existing column that contains JSON data.
